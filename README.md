## Introduction

This repository contains various C and C++ programs ranging from basic syntax tutorials to more advanced data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming. These programs serve both as learning material for myself and as a resource for others who want to explore C and C++.

## Features

- Examples of **basic syntax** and **control structures**.
- **Data Structures** implementation (Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.).
- **Algorithms** like Sorting, Searching, and Graph Traversal.
- **Memory management** techniques in C/C++.
- System-level programming and **multithreading** examples.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** examples in C++.
