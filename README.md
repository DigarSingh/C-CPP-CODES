## Introduction

This repository contains various C and C++ programs ranging from basic syntax tutorials to more advanced data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming. These programs serve both as learning material for myself and as a resource for others who want to explore C and C++.

## Features

- Examples of **basic syntax** and **control structures**.
- **Data Structures** implementation (Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.).
- **Algorithms** like Sorting, Searching, and Graph Traversal.
- **Memory management** techniques in C/C++.
- System-level programming and **multithreading** examples.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)** examples in C++.

## Installation

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. Ensure you have a working C and C++ compiler. For example, you can install GCC using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install gcc g++
    ```

## Usage

To compile and run any C or C++ program, use the following commands:

For C programs:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output

Make sure to replace `yourusername` and `repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repo name. You can customize it further based on your project specifics.
